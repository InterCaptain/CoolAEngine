[AE] M4A1 Inf Ammo


---READ ME---

When you install Alpha Engine and use M4A1 but u need infinite/inf ammo, go download the .rbxm file or maybe copy the code here :)

1. Copy the code.
2. Paste the code.
3. That's it all now. Bye!----


The code: (the Original M4A1)

Ammo = 30;
	StoredAmmo = 30;
	MagCount = math.huge;
	RoundType = '5.56x45mm';
  
  Put "math.huge" on the M4A1 ConfigMod script.
  
  AlphaResource - ConfigMods - M4A1 (ConfigMod script)
